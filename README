--------- Notes

Currently being developed and tested in Chrome.
But! Universal support (as per the jsUnity way) will be a definite goal.



--------- Getting Started

Place a test file anywhere you want (though tests/ is recommended).
Then just include it in index.html along with other tests. jsUnityRunner will pick up on it.

* Optional Test Suite Properties
	resetMarkup: resets the test markup before starting suite

See the examples folder for creating test suites.
