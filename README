jsUnityRunner : A lightweight wrapper GUI for testing using jsUnity.

(this is still in development, check back later) or see the jsUnity wiki: http://code.google.com/p/jsunity/w/list


* Notes *

Currently being developed and tested in Chrome.
At this time using Rhino (or other untested engines) will most likely fail.
But! Universal support (as per the jsUnity way) will be a definite goal.
