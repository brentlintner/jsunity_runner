--------- Notes

Currently being developed and tested in Chrome but should run fine in other browsers (Firefox, Opera, Safari, etc), no IE yet.
But! Universal support (as per the jsUnity way) will be a definite goal. Plus jsunity has a Rhino runner already.



--------- Getting Started

Test Suite objects are specified in "tests/tests.json" and picked up on load.

-- DOM content
Stored by default in "tests/markup.html"

You can also reset your markup each suite by setting "resetMarkup: true" in your suite object. 
If false it will be loaded once.

-- Examples
See the examples folder for creating various test suites including asynchronous tests.

-- Customizing Test Configurations
Check out "app/config.js" for more options such as changing test suite and markup file locations.


--------- tests.json

In your tests.json you can specify multiple test, script and stylesheet files to include in the runner.

{
  "tests": [] 
  "scripts": []
  "styles": []
}
