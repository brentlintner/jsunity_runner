------ Notes

Currently being developed and tested in Chrome.
At this time using Rhino (or other untested engines) will most likely fail.
But! Universal support (as per the jsUnity way) will be a definite goal.



------ Getting Started

Place a test file anywhere you want (though tests/ is recommended).
Then just include it in index.html along with other tests. jsUnityRunner will pick up on it.

* Options
	resetMarkup: resets the test markup before starting suite


(jsUnityRunner.Tests.AnotherSuite = function($j, $){

    return {
        
        suiteName: "-- Another Suite",

        resetMarkup: true,

        setUp: function(){ },
        
        tearDown: function(){ },

        test_example: function(){
            $j.assertions.assertNotNull(1);
        },

        test_example_two: function(){
            $j.assertions.assertNotNull(null);
        }
        
    };

}(jsUnity, jsUnityRunner));
